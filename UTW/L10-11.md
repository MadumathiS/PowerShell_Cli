# L10-11

The password for Century11 is the 10th and 8th word of the Windows Update service description combined PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.

NOTE:
– The password will be lowercase no matter how it appears on the screen.
– If the 10th and 8th word of the service description is “apple” and “juice” and the name of the file on the desktop is “88”, the password would be “applejuice88”.
