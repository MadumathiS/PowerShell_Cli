# The mission

We already had the opportunity to learn and use the Bash shell, but there are many other shells one could use. They all have their specificities, strengths and weaknesses; although they all work in similar manner they all answer to specific needs. One could says that knowing a new shell is like having a new tool in your toolset, this challenge will have you add Powershell to it.

Powershell is one of the most common shells in modern Windows systems, it has a different approach to Bash in that it manipulates data types instead of exclusively text I/O (input/output). Furthermore, since it's developped by Microsoft it's also deeply integrated into Windows enebling extensive Windows system configuration.

NOTE: Powershell is actually not a Windows exclusive shell, it can easily be used in Linux as well. However some of its functionalities are Windows specific and some of the exercises below will only be doable on a Windows system.

1. RTFM

2. Navigation

3. File operations

4. Permissions

5. Package Management

6. Environment Variables

7. Trial of Might


To validate this challenge we need to make a pull request on your training's repository with a file (<your_name>.txt, snake cased) containing a list of the passwords required to advance in the "Trial of Might" exercice. One password per line (if possible).
